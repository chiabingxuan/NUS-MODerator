st.markdown("This project was inspired by the course \"Develop LLM powered applications with LangChain\" on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/langchain/?srsltid=AfmBOop03tO6wEwm2yilQyRcysAl9VAgDja1VH9zKfJX5-N2EgK_JNr5&couponCode=LETSLEARNNOW). Yes, the course is hidden behind a paywall; no, I am not rich. Thankfully, I had access to Udemy Business throughout my internship at Synapxe. So, I would like to thank Synapxe for hiring me - I genuinely learnt a lot during my time there too.")
st.markdown("Many thanks to the people at NUSMods for providing me with assistance along the way, such as their guidance on how to access student reviews via the Disqus API.")
st.markdown("Shoutout to my senpai, [Roydon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roydon-tay/), for helping me out with LangChain retrieval augmented generation.")
st.markdown("Also a big thank you to my cousin, [Xi En](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xi-en-tan-5b065b1b2/), for teaching me how to host databases on the cloud for free. The man is an actual coding god - bro needs to be stopped.")
